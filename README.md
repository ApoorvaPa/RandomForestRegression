## Student Performance Prediction

This repository contains a Random Forest Regression model trained on a dataset of secondary school students, encompassing a variety of social, gender, and academic attributes. The primary objective is to predict students' final grades in Math by analyzing a range of factors, including parental education, study time, extracurricular activities, and more. The dataset, obtained from UCI, provides a robust framework for understanding how different variables impact academic performance.

### Dataset

The dataset offers detailed information organized into the following categories:

- **Demographics**: Includes information about the student's school, age, sex, and family size.
- **Academic Factors**: Encompasses variables such as study time, previous failures, grades, and other academic-related metrics.
- **Social Factors**: Covers aspects like family relationships, free time, and social activities, including going out.
- **Health & Lifestyle**: Considers factors like health status, alcohol consumption, and school absences.

### Usage

The Random Forest Regression model is designed for both exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predicting final grades based on various input features. Compared to a Decision Tree, Random Forest tends to perform better in many cases by reducing overfitting and improving prediction accuracy. It achieves this by aggregating the results of multiple decision trees, thereby providing a more generalized model. This approach offers deeper insights into how different factors contribute to students' academic outcomes, enabling more reliable data-driven predictions and analyses.
